# Heart Attack Analysis and Predections
Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset related to cardiovascular diseases, uncover key  factors influencing the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and develop a predictive model for heart attack detection.

#### Objective: 
The objective of the project is to perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset related to cardiovascular diseases. This includes data inspection, handling missing values and duplicates, exploring the relationships between various factors and the occurrence of heart attacks, building a baseline predictive model using logistic regression, and creating informative visualizations in Tableau to understand the attributes associated with diseased and healthy individuals. The goal is to gain insights into the factors influencing the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and develop a predictive model for heart attack detection.

Problem Statement:
Read the information given below and refer to the data dictionary provided separately in an excel file to build your understanding.
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. To identify the causes and to develop a system to predict heart attack in an effective manner is necessary. The presented data has all the information about all the relevant factors that might have an impact on heart health. The data needs to be explained in detail for any further analysis.
